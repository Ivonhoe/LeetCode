 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]'
 *
 * You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level,
 * and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following
 * definition:
 * 
 * 
 * struct Node {
 * ⁠ int val;
 * ⁠ Node *left;
 * ⁠ Node *right;
 * ⁠ Node *next;
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
 * next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * 
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
 * Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
 * Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function
 * should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like
 * in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the
 * next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: []
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2^12 - 1].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow-up:
 * 
 * 
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not
 * count as extra space for this problem.
 *
